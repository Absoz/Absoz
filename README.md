## Projects of note:

#### Modeling and Visualizing Avalanche Risk in the Colorado Rockies
  - Course: CS455 Distributed Systems
  - Used geospatial data (Lidar & 3DEP) from NASA, NOAA, USGS, and historical avalanche records from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) to create 3D and 2D maps of geographical avalanche risk and overlayed historical avalanche records using GIS software to create a data product useful for avalanche risk assessment and improving public safety in the backcountry.
  - Apache Hadoop Map/Reduce (JAVA), QGIS, GDAL, and a distributed download script (Bash & tmux) to pull data from public APIs without overloading the API or hitting the API limiters
#### Using Spark and Random Forests to classify water quality samples as wildfire affected using only water quality attributes
  - Course: CS435 Big Data
  - Used Apache Spark SQL and machine learning libraries to join the EPA's aggregated water quality data and the USFS wildfire occurrence database into several datasets of records with water-quality attributes and a one-hot encoded label indicating whether or not a given sample is within a specified temporal and spatial proximity to a known wildfire occurrence. These labeled datasets were used to train RF classifiers to determine if water-quality samples were wildfire-affected.
  - Apache Spark (Random Forest Classifier), HDFS, Scala, Java, Bash, and Python (Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) 
#### Parallelizing the Floyd-Warshall All Pair Shortest Path algorithm for GPU and profiling performance in comparison with CPU
  - Course: CS475 Parallel Programming
  - Parallelized the Floy-Warshall algorithm using blocking/tiling and a deep analysis of computational dependencies. This blocked parallel implementation was profiled and benchmarked compared against several other parallel implementations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm 
  - C, CUDA, Intel profiler, NVIDIA profiler and Bash 
#### Interactive Mapping and Route Optimization Web Application
  - Course: CS314 Software Engineering
  - Created a website where users could create trips either by selecting cities, entering latitude/longitude points, or clicking the map. Clients then had the option to have the website optimize a route between all of the selected locations. The Nearest-Neighbor algorithm with some optimizations was used to calculate the optimal route.
  - React Javascript front end and Java/SQL backend exposed through REST APIs, npm, maven, TDD (JUnit, Jest, and Postman), CI/CD pipelines, project requirements specification experience, git, and Github
#### Project Management Application
  - Course: CS415 Software Testing
  - Created project management software using test driven development processes and procedures.
  - Javascript, Java, SQL, TDD, graph-based testing, input space partitioning testing, unit testing, integration testing, input fuzzing, finite state machines, and automated test generation using Selenium. 
#### Using Machine Learning to classify and analyze Malware Samples
  - Course: CS456 Modern Cybersecurity
  - Used python machine learning to classify code samples as malware or benign, and to perform statistical analysis on the malware distribution.
  - Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit, Jupyter Notebooks
